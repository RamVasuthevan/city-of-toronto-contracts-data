Current land use in the area consists of large-format retail buildings and surface parking with low-rise commercial and industrial buildings to the north and south of Eglinton Avenue East.   •	The Eglinton Crosstown Light Rail Transit (ECLRT) will pass through the Golden Mile and has five surface transit platforms constructed that will help transition the area into a mixed-use, transit-oriented community. A number of development applications have been submitted within the Golden Mile and are currently under review. The latest population proposed for the Golden Mile includes is approximately 67,000 new residents and 9,000 new jobs, which exceeds the City’s population forecasts.   •	Current sanitary drainage areas show that the Golden Mile is currently serviced by two trunk sewers: the Bermondsey Sanitary Trunk Sewer to the west and the Massey Creek Sanitary and Relief Trunk Sewers to the east, with a drainage divide generally at Warden Avenue. •	A master servicing report for the redevelopment of the Golden Mile was carried out by a landowners’ group in early 2020 and updated in 2022. Several servicing alternatives were considered and ultimately recommended upgrades on both the developer and City side to accommodate the Golden Mile development area. These previous studies and recommendations have led the City to this current study which will evaluate and confirm capacity in the trunk system considering the City projected 2051 populations and the latest proposed developments within a wider study area.   •	The Supplier will develop an implementation plan and strategy to prioritize and sequence the recommended wastewater system upgrades and improvements to align with projected incremental growth. The City anticipates the solution will benefit both the existing system and future growth.",,Ward 16 Don Valley East
