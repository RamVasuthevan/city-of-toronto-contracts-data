174,5474040786,RFT,Notice of Intended Procurement,2025-12-30,2026-02-06,Construction Services,"The Western Beaches Tunnel (WBT) system (refer to Figure 1) collects and treats combined sewer overflows (CSO) and stormwater from ten existing CSO and storm sewer outfalls. Constructed in the late 1990's, the system consists of a 3 metre diameter, 3.6 kilometre long storage tunnel that runs parallel to Lake Ontario, from approximately Parkside Drive to Strachan Avenue, with three main storage shafts (approximately 25 metres diameter by 35 to 40 metres deep) located at the Battery Park (785 Lake Shore Blvd. W.), Cowan (1075 Lake Shore Blvd. W.) and Glendale (1725 Lake Shore Blvd. W.) sites, six drop shafts, ten sewer interception chambers, nine lake isolation chambers, and a pumping station with ultra-violet (UV) disinfection system. The Parkside Drive sewer interception chamber (located about 130m west of the Glendale sewer interception chamber) includes an approximate 45m long open channel emergency overflow to the lake. The entire WBT system has an 85,000 cubic metre storage volume and was designed to improve water quality conditions at the City of Toronto’s nearby swimming beaches and along Toronto's waterfront.     This WBT Phase 2 construction project involves a complete retrofit of the existing Battery Park pumping station building. As an overview, the general work scope includes removal of all electrical, mechanical, HVAC, process, instrumentation, SCADA/automation, shaft access stairs, pumping system, tunnel flushing system, shaft sediment fluidization system and UV system equipment (the pumping station structure including the floors, walls and roof will be retained) and replacement with all new equipment. Related, but significantly less extensive, work is also required at the Cowan, Glendale and Parkside sites. A more detailed summary of the work scope consists of, but is not limited to, the following major work: 1.	Management of the construction works and integration with ongoing facilities and operations. 2.	Provision of all temporary measures and works (including equipment, piping, civil, mechanical, electrical, instrumentation and control) to complete work under this Contract including disposal of any contaminated soil and groundwater, and management of any sewer infiltration/leakage flows. A major temporary measure will be the construction and operation of a temporary pumping system capable of pumping up to 300 L/s to remove inflow/infiltration and overflow water that enters the WBT system so that construction work can proceed under dry conditions within the system. 3.	Demolition, removal and modification of the existing equipment, piping, structures, mechanical, electrical, instrumentation and control systems as shown on the drawings and described in the specifications. Disposal of removed unwanted equipment, piping, structures, excavated materials, dewatering water and contaminated materials off site resulting from the demolition, removal, excavation and construction works. Finish the removal and modification surfaces to match adjacent surface conditions by filling, grout, painting or other required means. 4.	Coordination and cooperation with the City is required for temporary measures and for continuous operation of the facilities, maintenance and access, connections to the existing facilities, installation of new equipment, buildings, structures, mechanical, electrical and control systems. Coordinate mechanical, process systems and electrical installations. 5.	Furnish, install and/or supervise installation, start-ups, testing, corrections if needed, commissioning and training. The project work scope includes:  (A)	Replacing the existing two pump system with 2 decant pumps and 2 dewatering pumps, including pump mounts and pump retrieval systems;  (B)	Install new actuators for the existing three flushing gates and the new lake water intake chamber isolation gate.
